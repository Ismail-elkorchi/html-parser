# Architecture & evaluation decision records (ADRs)

Rules:
1) Decisions that affect “best” status must be written down.
2) ADRs are numbered and immutable once accepted (append new ADRs if decisions change).

Naming:

- ADR-001-... fixture skip decisions
- ADR-002-... gate/threshold changes
- ADR-003-... oracle choice and normalization rules
- ADR-004-... dataset updates (fixtures, entities)
- ADR-005-... dev dependency additions

Minimum sections:
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences
